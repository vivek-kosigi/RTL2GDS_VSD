# Week 2 Task 1 
# 📘 SoC Design Fundamentals & VSDBabySoC  

## 🔹 What is an SoC?  
A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is an integrated circuit that combines all the essential components of a complete computing system on a single chip.  
It typically includes:  
- CPU  
- GPU  
- Memory  
- DSP  
- Power management  
- Peripherals (UART, WiFi, Bluetooth, Timers, etc.)  

👉 Found in almost every electronic device today: **smartphones, laptops, smartwatches, IoT devices, medical equipment, and vehicles.**  

### ✅ Why SoC?  
- **Space Saving** 🧩 – all components on one chip → portable design  
- **Energy Efficient** ⚡ – shorter interconnects reduce power loss  
- **High Performance** 🚀 – faster communication between blocks  
- **Cost Effective** 💰 – cheaper than assembling multiple chips

### 🔹 Why BabySoC?
**BabySoC** is a simplified SoC model used in the VSD training program to help learners build foundational knowledge of SoC design.  

- It strips away the overwhelming complexity of real-world SoCs.  
- Focuses on **core concepts** like CPU-memory interaction, peripheral integration, and bus-level communication.  
- Provides a **hands-on learning environment** before diving into industrial-scale designs.  
- Acts as a **bridge between theory and RTL/PD practice**, making it a perfect learning platform.

# 🔹 Role of Functional Modeling
Before writing RTL or moving into **physical design**, it is crucial to model and validate system functionality.  

- ✅ **Functional Modeling** allows verifying that the SoC architecture (CPU + memory + interconnect + peripherals) works correctly.  
- ✅ Helps identify **design bugs early**, reducing rework in later stages.  
- ✅ Ensures smooth transition from **high-level system concepts → RTL coding → physical design implementation**.  

With **BabySoC**, learners get exposure to this workflow by modeling simplified SoCs, understanding **system behavior first**, and then mapping it into design and implementation.
