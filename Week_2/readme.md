# 🖥️ Week 2: BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling 

Welcome to **Week 2** of the VLSI System Design (VSD) training program.  
This folder contains 2 tasks 
- task 1 the theory of BabySOC
- task 2 simulation of BabySOC

---

## 📘 Task-wise Summary

### 🚀 [Task 1: Conceptual theory of BabySOC](./task_1)
- Learned the architecture and block-level organization of BabySoC including RVMYTH core, DAC, and PLL.
- Performed a theoretical study on how the processor interacts with analog and digital components.
- Explored the data path between the RVMYTH and DAC modules.

### 📚 [Task 2: Simulation & waveform understanding](./task_2)
- Explored and cloned the VSDBabySoC GitHub repository.
- Converted .tlv files into synthesizable .v files using Sandpiper.
- Implemented simulation using Icarus Verilog to generate .vcd waveform files.
- Analyzed the BabySoC signals such as clock, reset, and dataflow in GTKWave.
- Verified the correct functionality of BabySoC through waveform interpretation.
