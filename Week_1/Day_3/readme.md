## üåü Introduction

Optimization is key to achieving better **area efficiency**, **power savings**, and **higher clock frequencies** in digital circuits. On Day 3, we focused on practical optimization techniques for **combinational** and **sequential** logic, exploring their uses and impacts in real designs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Combinational Logic Optimization

### üîç Why Optimize Combinational Logic?

- **Squeeze the logic** to reduce chip area and dynamic power consumption.  
- Simplify Boolean functions for efficient hardware use.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Constant Propagation Optimization

Substitutes constant inputs directly into logic expressions to remove or simplify gates.

**Example:**  

If   
```
Y = ((A * B) + C)'

and (A = 0), then

Y = ((0 * B) + C)' = C'
```

This reduces gate count by removing logic related to \(A\).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Boolean Logic Optimizations

Uses algebraic laws and automated algorithms to simplify Boolean logic, minimizing gate usage and improving speed.

## üîÑ Sequential Logic Optimization

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Constant Propagation in Sequential Logic

If a flip-flop's input \(D\) is constant, output \(Q\) reaches that constant, possibly eliminating redundant logic unless asynchronous controls are present.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ State Optimizations

Minimizes finite state machines by removing unused states and merging equivalent ones to simplify logic and reduce flip-flop counts.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Retiming

Repositions flip-flops across combinational paths to balance delays, decreasing critical path length and boosting clock frequency.

**Example:**  
Original delays: 5ns and 2ns ‚áí max frequency ‚âà 200 MHz  
Balanced delays: 4ns and 3ns ‚áí max frequency ‚âà 250 MHz  
Latency unchanged, throughput improved.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Sequential Logic Cloning

Replicates flip-flops driving many loads to reduce fanout delay and fix timing violations by distributing the load.

## üõ† Lab Activities

### Combinational Synthesis

- Synthesized five designs: `opt_check2`, `opt_check3`, `opt_check4`, `multiple_module_opt`, and `multiple_module_opt2`.
- Observed how synthesis uses basic gates (AND, OR, 3-input AND, XNOR) and manages multiple modules to implement multiplexers.

### Sequential Synthesis

- Simulated and synthesized `diff_const3`, `diff_const4`, `diff_const5`.
- Verified constant propagation and sequential logic optimizations.

### Unused Port Optimization

- Compared `counter_opt` (driving one output) to `counter_opt2` (driving all outputs).
- Noticed how tools prune unneeded logic to minimize area and power.

## üìå Summary

- **Constant propagation and Boolean simplification** streamline combinational circuits.  
- **State reduction, retiming, and cloning** enhance sequential performance and timing.  
- Synthesis tools automate these optimizations, saving design time and improving chip efficiency.
