# 🧩 Week 3: Synthesis, Gate-Level Simulation & STA

Welcome to Week 3 of the VLSI System Design (VSD) training program!  
This week focuses on essential backend concepts — covering synthesis, gate-level simulation, and static timing analysis — bridging the gap between RTL design and gate-level implementation.

## 📘 Overview

This folder contains three core tasks that form the foundation of the chip implementation flow:

| 🧠 Task | 🧾 Description |
|--------|---------------|
| **Task 1 – Synthesis & GLS** | Learn how RTL is translated into a gate-level netlist using standard cell libraries. Perform Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) to verify functionality after synthesis. |
| **Task 2 – STA Theory** | Understand the principles of Static Timing Analysis (STA) including setup and hold checks, timing paths, and slack calculations. |
| **Task 3 – Practical on OpenSTA** | Gain hands-on experience with the OpenSTA tool to analyze timing reports, constraints, and path delays practically. |

## ⚙️ Key Learning Outcomes

- Understand how synthesis maps RTL into gates using standard cell libraries (.lib files).  
- Explore Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) for post-synthesis timing and functional verification.  
- Acquire both theoretical and practical knowledge of Static Timing Analysis (STA).  
- Learn to use OpenSTA for timing validation and slack analysis.

## 🧩 Tools Used

- **Yosys** – for RTL synthesis  
- **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** – for simulation and GLS  
- **OpenSTA** – for static timing analysis  
- **GTKWave** – for viewing simulation waveforms

## 🚀 Summary

By the end of Week 3, you will have a thorough understanding of how your Verilog RTL design evolves into a gate-level netlist, how its timing is validated through STA, and how to interpret timing reports. This marks a critical transition from design-level concepts to implementation-level insights.
